```{r}
# coerce a data frame to a tibble
library(tidyverse)
as_tibble(iris)

# create a new tibble from individual vectors with tibble(). tibble() will automatically recycle inputs of length 1
tibble(x = 1:5,
       y = 1,
       z = x ^ 2 + y)

# tribble(), short for transposed tibble. to lay out small amounts of data
tribble(~x, ~y, ~z,
        "a", 2, 3.6,
        "b", 1, 8.5) # the formulas showed the header
```

# Print
```{r}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  print(n = 5, width = Inf) # width = Inf will print all the columns # section 10.3.1 introduces how to print
```

# Subsetting
```{r}
# [[ can extract by name or position; $ only extracts by name but is a little less typing.
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

# extract by name
df$x; df[["x"]]; df[[1]] # extract a column
df[[2]] # extract a column
df[[3,1]] # extract an element
df %>% slice(3); df[3,] # extract a row

# to use this in a pipe, you'll need a special placeholder .
df %>% .$x
df %>% .[["x"]]
```

# Interacting with older code
# Some older functions donâ€™t work with tibbles. If you encounter one of these functions, use as.data.frame() to turn a tibble back to a data.frame.

# Exercise
```{r}
# 1. How can you tell if an object is a tibble?
# a tibble will print 10 rows as default and always says it's a tibble and shows the type of each column. a data frame will print all the rows and columns.

# 2. Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. 
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x # data frame does partial matching
df[,"xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")] # sometimes it returns a vector and sometimes it returns a data frame.

df1 <- as_tibble(df)
df1$x # return NULL, tibble doesn't do partial matching
df1[,"xyz"]
df1[, c("abc", "xyz")] # [ always returns a tibble

# 3. If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?
df <- as_tibble(mtcars)
var <- "mpg"
df %>% .[[var]] # can't use $, have to use [[]]. it returns a vector

df %>% 
  select(one_of(var)) # returns a tibble with only one variable

# 4. Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by (1) Extracting the variable called 1. (2) Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2. (3) Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1. (4) Renaming the columns to one, two and three.
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)

annoying %>% .$'1' # by name
annoying %>% .[['1']] # by name
annoying %>% .[[1]] # by position

annoying %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(.$'1'), y = .$'2')) + # when refering to non-syntactice names, you'll have to use the subsetting way to refer to them
  geom_point()

annoying %>% 
  mutate('3' = .$'1'/.$'2') %>% 
  rename(one = '1', two = '2', three = '3')

# 5. What does tibble::enframe() do? When might you use it?
# enframe() converts named atomic vectors or lists to 2-column data frames. deframe() converts 2-column data frames to a named vector or list.

# 6. What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?
?print.tbl_df
print(nycflights13::flights, n_extra = 2)
